What need to be done:
- reorganize main menu
	- Hive managment
		- Overview (page with all hives and all apiaries
		- Add hive? (maybe)
		- Update hive? (maybe)
		
- clean code from controllers which are written
- for measurements
	- make an overview over all hives (into small blocks)
		- one block = one apiary.... each apiary will have multiple divs / hives with data:
			- green or red icon if measurement is in last 30minute or not)
			- last value of the measurements (temperature / humidity)
			- under icon of apiary will be also if data are active (red / green) and values of measuring there)

- fix Export of data
	- fix the ZIP file creating
	- add Export of inspections (the same as measurements methods)
	
- make an new CSS for whole web
- make statistic page about how many measurements we have and etc.
	(maybe on main page?
